Assumtion:
  - useWalletBalances() - assume this would return balance of user (array of WalletBalance type)
  - usePrices() - this would return a price subject like {"Osmosis": 1, "Ethereum": 2}

Issue: 
  - children const is unsed, can be removed
  - Type of parameter blockchain in function getPriority should be string not any
  - lhsPriority is not defined, and it is used in the condition of balances.filter => lhsPriority should be replaced by balancePriority
  - balance.blockchain, lhs.blockchain are rhs.blockchain is not defined should be replace by balance.currency, lhs.currency are rhs.currency as balance, lhs and rhs type are WalletBalance
  - balancePriority, leftPriority, rightPriority are lacking of type number
  - Got Spaghetti code for the two if in the balances.filter function. Also the condition should be check for balance.amount > 0 (Would make more sense)
  - Sort function is lacking of return 0. Should be replace by return rightPriority - leftPriority for a Descending sort
  - Lacking of type for formattedBalances => Should be FormattedWalletBalance[]
  - toFixed function is lacking of decimal number => can be toFixed(2) or toFixed(3)
  - classes.row is not defined
